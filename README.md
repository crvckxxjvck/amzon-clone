# 🛒 Amazon Clone

This is a simple Amazon-style frontend clone made with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

You can:
- Browse products
- Add items to the cart
- Go through a multi-step checkout
- See your previous orders
- Track your order status

No frameworks, no build tools — just clean structure and logic, split into separate JS modules for each part of the app.

Everything is saved in `localStorage`, so your cart and orders stay even if you refresh the page.
